# This reusable workflow accepts a list of hostnames to test along with files containing what paths to use for each hostname.
# This function will look for a file with the same name as the hostname with the .json extension. 
# For example, if you are testing site1.com you need the file ./testfiles/site1.com.json, the format for this file
# can be found here https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-urls
